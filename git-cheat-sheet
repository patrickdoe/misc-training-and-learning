----------------

git commit
git checkout
git branch
git rebase <branch1> <branch2>

git HEAD^
git HEAD~3
git branch -f main HEAD~3            # Reassign a branch to a commit with the -f option

git revert (Remote use)              # Will move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place.
git reset  (Local use)               # Reverses changes by moving a branch reference backwards in time to an older commit.

git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>

git rebase -i HEAD~4
